# About
A quick and dirty HearthStone card database made with angular and jQuery. Quickly search and sort all cards in HearthStone (including ones that aren't collectible).
In it's current state, this app is focused on using angular (and a little but of jQuery) combined with a simple JSON file for cards. This not the greatest way to build a HearthStone card database, but it does demonstrat just how easy it is to get something up and running with Angular.

# Installation
